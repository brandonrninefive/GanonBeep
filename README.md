GanonBeep
=========

A streaming tool and stat-tracker for the Super Smash Bros. series developed by SiGMelee (a branch of NJIT's chapter of ACM).

GanonBeep is written in C++ and uses wxWidgets 3.0.1 for development.  You can get wxWidgets here: http://www.wxwidgets.org/

For simplicity when installing wxWidgets, we reccomend you use the Code::Blocks IDE (the one with MinGW).  You can get Code::Blocks here: http://www.codeblocks.org/
